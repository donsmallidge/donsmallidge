- 👋 Hi, I’m @donsmallidge
- 👀 I’m interested in chess, Java for web development. I'm a retired Java programmer, interested in using my experience to work on my own projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Spring Boot with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an interactive chess web application, using a Java chess engine on a web page (instead of Java Swing window). 
The project is pretty "seat of the pants" at this stage, but I would welcome help to be more organized about it. This is a hobby, not a commercial project.
- 📫 How to reach me: donaldsmallidge@mac.com
